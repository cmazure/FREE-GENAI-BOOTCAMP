#  Functional Requirements

We were asked to build a large language learnign model by the Orlando School systems for the purpose of assisting their students to develope additional language skills beyond their native language. They have asked us to design the platform to start to teach students French but intends on expanding it to include other languages.

They plan on making the paltform available to the wider school district but is concerned with the long term and ongoing costs of a hosted platform and want to investigate the cost of developing and hosting the platform in their own datacenter. They initiall plan on purchasing an AI PC in the price range of $10,000 to $15,000 as an initial investment.
