##  Functional Requirements

We were asked to build a large language learnign model by the Orlando School systems for the purpose of assisting their students to develope additional language skills beyond their native language. They have asked us to design the platform to start to teach students Japanese but intends on expanding it to include other languages.

They plan on making the paltform available to the wider school district but is concerned with the long term and ongoing costs of a hosted platform and want to investigate the cost of developing and hosting the platform in their own datacenter. They initiall plan on purchasing an AI PC in the price range of $10,000 to $15,000 as an initial investment.

## Assumptions

We are hoping that using an open source model to provide language learning capabilities will reduce the overall cost of the project without incurring additional cost doing API calls to a paid model.

## Data Strategy

We are hoping to ingest learning materials that we have acquired over the years and are concerned with copyright issues. Our hope is to use an open source model like IBM Granite or another to be determined after additional research. https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite
