## Examples
<example>

<user:input
Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
</user:input>

    <assistant:output>
    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a table of vocabulary:
    Japanese	Romaji	English
    くま	kuma	bear
    ドア	doa	door
    ごみ	gomi	garbage
    残す	nokosu	leave
    外	soto	outside
    Possible sentence structure:
    [Topic] + [Location] + [Verb] + [Particle] + [Question]
    Here's an example of a simple sentence using the vocabulary:
    , (Kuma wa doa ni imasu)
    Now, let's think about the original sentence structure:
    What is the topic of the first clause?
    How would you express the location "at the door" in Japanese?
    To express "bears" as the topic, think about how to make "kuma" the main focus of the sentence.
    Please take a stab at the first clause, and I'll provide guidance from there.
